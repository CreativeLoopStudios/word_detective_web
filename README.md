Browser game made using React + Firebase. We plan to release the project for free in the future.

## :pencil: Overview

Word Detective is a real-time party game meant to be played with a group of friends.

Each round a player will be a Word Master that is responsible for choosing a secret word between a group of categories.

After the word is selected the Word Detectives (the other players) have the objective to discover which word was chosen. The detectives can type questions for the Word Master in order to get more information about the word and the Word Master will have the possibility to answer questions only using "Yes" or "No".

After a question is answered the detectives will have the opportunity to guess the secret word.

The rounds will continue in loop like that and the first detective to correctly guess the word will gain points together with the Word Master. The points won by the Word Master will depend how fast (in rounds) the detectives guessed the secret word.
